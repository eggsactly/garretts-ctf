# About
This is a hack-able, Capture-the-Flag program source code for a program that 
requires login. It allows users to type in their usernames and passwords and 
access a system.

This is designed to make security researchers derive a valid username and 
password combo from scanning the binary. The password is obscured with an 
encryption algorithm. Researchers must find the encrypted password in the 
binary and figure out how to decrypt it. 

# Cloning 
This repo uses sub-modules, when cloning use 
```
git clone git@github.com:eggsactly/garretts-ctf.git --recurse-submodules
```

To get all sub-modules when you clone this repo. 

# Building 
The build process for this project uses Make. There are three targets for this
project

```
make all
make debug
make clean
```

For building for a basic CTF challenge, we recommend using `make debug` because
the resulting binary will contain a debugging symbol table. 

# Plan of Attack

Get read-only data in the binary. If the password is encoded in the binary, in 
any form, it will be in this section of the binary. 
```
$ objdump -sj .rodata garretts-ctf

```

From this list, we get a clue as to what a potential valid username may be for
the application: *bort*. 

We need to find out which offset this is in an executing binary. The 
offsets in the binary where this data resides is in the left most numbers, 
they are expressed as hex. 

We can make some educated guesses as to where the password or encryption keys 
are. They are not going to be anywhere we have readable text. 

Open up gdb, and get the info proc map of the running binary 

```

There are two addresses where our .rodata is loaded into in this example 
(yours will be different):0x555555558000 and 0x555555559000, this is because 
there are two start addresses for the offset 0x4000, which is where .rodata 
resides in the binary. 

We can set watch points for address accesses. 
```
(gdb) rwatch *0x555555558020 
(gdb) rwatch *0x555555558030
(gdb) rwatch *0x5555555580b0
```

Warning, you're limited on hardware watch-points, so you may have to make several
iterations of this until you hit a watch point, which will lead you to code that
needs encryption. 

Continue through the application enough and we'll see we hit a watch point. 

```
Hardware read watchpoint 2: *0x555555558020

Value = -4378796
application (hashTable=0x55555555b2a0) at main.c:87
87	            if((char)(output->encrypt_pw)[i] != (char)inputPassword[i])
(gdb) 
```

If we do this enough, we'll find interesting parts of the code

```
(gdb) bt
#0  application (hashTable=0x55555555b2a0) at main.c:87
#1  0x000055555555524b in main () at main.c:33
(gdb) l
82	    
83	        encrypt(inputPassword, sizeOfInputPass, encrkey, ENCRYPTION_MODE);
84	        int pw_comp = 0;
85	        for(i = 0; i < message_size_calc; i++)
86	        {
87	            if((char)(output->encrypt_pw)[i] != (char)inputPassword[i])
88	            {
89	                pw_comp = i;
90	            }
91	        }
(gdb) 
```

For example, we have now found the encryption function `encrypt`, and all of 
its inputs. The most important thing is that we have found the address to the 
encryption key.
```
(gdb) p (void *) encrkey
$6 = (void *) 0x555555558038 <encrkey>
```
which is this part from .rodata

```
 4030 ________ ________ 1d055ce1 4a60bd00  ..........\.J`..
```

We also get clues that this function is reversible if we pass a 0 in for the 
last parameter of encrypt. 

We can also get the size of the encrypted password by printing 
message\_size\_calc

```
(gdb) p message_size_calc 
$10 = 16
```

We can also conclude that the output of encrypt is being compared to an 
already encrypted password. 

Therefore, we can conclude that the already encrypted password for user *bort*
is in address output->encrypt_pw

```
p (char *) output->encrypt_pw 
$11 = 0x555555558020 <password> "T/\275\377\3642\032#k\216:Ö—j", <incomplete sequence \314>
```
And this does not exceed 16 bytes in size. 

Therefore, the encrypted password is this part of .rodata
```
 4020 542fbdff f4321a23 6b8e3ad6 976a2acc  T/...2.#k.:..j*.
```

We can use the encrypt function to do the decryption for us, but since the 
0x555555558020 address lives in .rodata, we cannot modify that data in-place,
rather we will need to transfer it to another storage location and then run 
encrypt on it. inputPassword will work well as a temporary location. 

If you run this in gdb, this will give you the password for user *bort*.
```
(gdb) set inputPassword[0] = *((char *)0x555555558020)
(gdb) set inputPassword[1] = *((char *)0x555555558021)
(gdb) set inputPassword[2] = *((char *)0x555555558022)
(gdb) set inputPassword[3] = *((char *)0x555555558023)
(gdb) set inputPassword[4] = *((char *)0x555555558024)
(gdb) set inputPassword[5] = *((char *)0x555555558025)
(gdb) set inputPassword[6] = *((char *)0x555555558026)
(gdb) set inputPassword[7] = *((char *)0x555555558027)
(gdb) set inputPassword[8] = *((char *)0x555555558028)
(gdb) set inputPassword[9] = *((char *)0x555555558029)
(gdb) set inputPassword[10] = *((char *)0x55555555802a)
(gdb) set inputPassword[11] = *((char *)0x55555555802b)
(gdb) set inputPassword[12] = *((char *)0x55555555802c)
(gdb) set inputPassword[13] = *((char *)0x55555555802d)
(gdb) set inputPassword[14] = *((char *)0x55555555802e)
(gdb) set inputPassword[15] = *((char *)0x55555555802f)
(gdb) set inputPassword[16] = *((char *)0x555555558030)
(gdb) call encrypt(inputPassword, 16, encrkey, 0)
(gdb) p inputPassword
```

Now you will have the password and you will be able to log in.
